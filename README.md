# Recipe Scaler

This program allows users to scale ingredient amounts for recipes accurately. It supports fractional and decimal representations and ensures input validation.

- **Flexible Scaling**: Supports any positive scaling factor (e.g., 0.5 for half, 2 for double, etc.).
- **Fractional Approximation**: Converts scaled amounts into the closest 1/8 fraction.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the user enters a valid, positive numeric value.

## Example Usage
```
Enter the original ingredient amount (in cups, tbsp, tsp, or grams): 2.5
Enter the scaling factor (e.g., 0.5 for half, 2 for double, etc.): 0.5

--- Scaled Ingredient Amount ---
New amount: 1.25 (approximate decimal)
Fractional equivalent: 10/8 cups/tbsp/tsp/grams
```
